# cartagena-cs

A client>server implementation of the classic board game Cartagena done using Reagent and sente.

## Overview

During clojure/conj 2015, I attended a presentation on the merits of functional design versus classical OO.  The presentation itself was good, but I was mostly intrigued by the demo the presenter gave.  It was a clojure implementation of Cartagena, and I left the conference wondering if I could do something similar.  That led to a series of implementations, beginning with a simple console app, progressing to a single-window web app, and culminating in this app, a fully-functional web-enabled remote multi-player implementation.

Note that this was an experiment in a lot of things, and I don't have any real intention of making it industrial-grade.  As a result, it's still rough around the edges, but should be stable enough to have a go at.  Feel free to add issues where you see them.
